This was an assingment for the Code Fellows Ruby on Rails Development Accelerator, it  involved following along with railscast: http://railscasts.com/episodes/417-foundation?view=asciicast so a thank you to Ryan Bates for the video. It involved using using the zurb foundation framework for the front end of a simple rails store model. This app had a product model that was created by running a scaffold generator, so there are all the crud options available to it.
